## Tasks

### 0. 0SI model

Questions:

What is the OSI model?

1. Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
2. The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
